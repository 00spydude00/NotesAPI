# NotesAPI

This project is not meant to be anything truly useful yet, it is mostly to learn ASP.NET for an internship.

I have yet to host this anywhere so if you want to use it, you will have to run it yourself.

If you want to run this project yourself:

run "dotnet ef database update" to recreate the notes.db database. Currently sqlite.

run "dotnet run" to run the api.

Please make sure you have dotnet packages installed, including necessary ones for ASP.NET Core.
